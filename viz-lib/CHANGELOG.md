### üîÑ Migration Guide

#### For Consuming Applications
1. **Update React**: Ensure React version is 16.14.0 or higher
2. **Webpack 5**: Verify compatibility with Webpack 5 if using custom build configurations
3. **Color Palette API**: Update any code using ColorPalette exports to new structure
4. **Moment.js**: Replace any dependencies on moment.js with alternative date libraries

#### For Contributors
1. **Use Yarn**: Run `yarn install` instead of `npm install`
2. **Webpack 5**: Familiarize yourself with Webpack 5 configuration patterns
3. **TypeScript**: Enhanced type checking may require addressing new type errors
