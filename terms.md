Therefore, we present to you a short summary to help you decide if you want to read the full terms, or just keep the tl;dr version and reject the terms.

When you confirm these terms upon registration, we need you to acknowledge that you read the full terms, and not just this summary.

Redash is a service which allows you to visualize and monitor information you allow it to access, such as your databases and other data sources. It is not a magical item.

If you don’t want to provide Redash with this information, you can download a copy of Redash’s source code and run it on your servers. Heck, downloading is free for now!

When you use the Redash service, it will keep a copy of some of your information and use it to provide you with the service. Read Redash’s privacy policy to understand more.
