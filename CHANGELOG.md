- Fix: dashboard list pagination didn't work

## v10.0.0-beta - 2021-06-16

Just over a year since our last release, the V10 beta is ready. Since we never made a non-beta release of V9, we expect many users will upgrade directly from V8 -> V10. This will bring a lot of exciting features. Please check out the V9 beta release notes below to learn more.

This V10 beta incorporates fixes for the feedback we received on the V9 beta along with a few long-requested features (horizontal bar charts!) and other changes to improve UX and reliability.

This release was made possible by contributions from 35+ people (the Github API didn't let us pull handles this time around): Alex Kovar, Alexander Rusanov, Arik Fraimovich, Ben Amor, Christopher Grant, Đặng Minh Dũng, Daniel Lang, deecay, Elad Ossadon, Gabriel Dutra, iwakiriK, Jannis Leidel, Jerry, Jesse Whitehouse, Jiajie Zhong, Jim Sparkman, Jonathan Hult, Josh Bohde, Justin Talbot, koooge, Lei Ni, Levko Kravets, Lingkai Kong, max-voronov, Mike Nason, Nolan Nichols, Omer Lachish, Patrick Yang, peterlee, Rafael Wendel, Sebastian Tramp, simonschneider-db, Tim Gates, Tobias Macey, Vipul Mathur, and Vladislav Denisov

Our special thanks to [Sohail Ahmed](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/sohail-ahmed-755776184) for reporting a vulnerability in our "forgot password" page (#5425)

### Upgrading

(This section is duplicated from the previous release - since many users will upgrade directly from V8 -> V10)

Typically, if you are running your own instance of Redash and wish to upgrade, you would simply modify the Docker tag in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Since RQ has replaced Celery in this version, there are a couple extra modifications that need to be done in your `docker-compose.yml`:

1. Under `services/scheduler/environment`, omit `QUEUES` and `WORKERS_COUNT` (and omit `environment` altogether if it is empty).
2. Under `services`, add a new service for general RQ jobs:

```yaml
worker:
  <<: *redash-service
  command: worker
  environment:
    QUEUES: "periodic emails default"
    WORKERS_COUNT: 1
```

Following that, force a recreation of your containers with `docker-compose up --force-recreate --build` and you should be good to go.
### UX
- Redash now uses a vertical navbar

## v8.0.0-beta - 2019-08-18

After months of being heads down with hard work, it's finally time to wrap up the V8 release 🤩 This release includes many long awaited improvements to parameters, UX improvements, further React migration and other changes, fixes and improvements.

While this version is already running on the hosted platform to make sure it's stable, we're excited to put this in the hands of our Open Source users.

Starting from this release we will no longer build a tarball distribution of the codebase and recommend everyone to switch over to using our Docker images. We're planning on dropping Python 2 support towards its EOL this year and switching over to the Docker image will make this transition much simpler.

## v7.0.0 - 2019-03-17

We're trying a new format for the CHANGELOG in this release. Focusing on the bigger changes, but for whoever interested, you can see all the changes [here](https://github.com/getredash/redash/compare/v6.0.0...master).

Besides all the features, bug fixes and improvements listed below we managed to convert a large portion of Redash's frontend code from Angular.js to React. You can see status in [#3071](https://github.com/getredash/redash/issues/3071).

This release was made possible with the help of 34 contributors. 🙇‍♂️

### Data Sources

- **All data source options are now encrypted in the database.** By default the encryption uses the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` value (`redash.settings.COOKIE_SECRET`), but you can specify a different value by setting the `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variable value. Note that you need to set this _before_ doing the upgrade.
- New Data Sources: Uptycs and Apache Drill.
- Snowplow: is now enabled by default & supports region setting.
- Elasticsearch: add support for Amazon Elasticsearch IAM authentication (with IAM profile or key/secret pair).
- PostgreSQL: add support for serializing range values.
- Redshift: remove duplicate column information for late-binding views.
- Athena: load all databases (using pagination).
- BigQuery: correctly handle temp tables with no schema field.
- Jira (JQL): support for fetching all records with pagination.
- Prometheus: fix schema loading and add support for query range.

### In-app Help

You can now open the [Knowledge Base](https://redash.io/help) inside the application. We also added a few "help triggers" in the app, that will open the Knowledge Base in context of what you're currently doing.

### Parameters

- **Dashboard Parameters**: We improved the flow of adding queries with parameters to dashboards and now give you full control over how parameters are mapped. You no longer have to make sure all parameters have the same name or use the `Global` checkbox. We also added new options, like keeping the parameter local to the widget or setting a static value. [Read more in our Knowledge Base →](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/querying/query-parameters#Parameter-Mapping-on-Dashboards)
- We added server side validation of parameter values for all parameter types, except for parameters of `text` type. All validated parameter types are considered safe. When a query is using safe parameters (or no parameters at all), View Only users can refresh it.
- Refreshing safe queries is done using the new results API endpoint, which takes only a query ID (and optionally parameter values) and does not need the query text.

### Query Editor Improvements

- Run only the highlighted query text: hit Execute after highlighting a portion of your query and only the selected portion will be sent to the database. This is useful for testing sub-SELECT statements and CTE's.
- Improved auto complete: add a dot . after a table name in the query editor and auto complete will only suggest columns on that table.
- Autosave parameter configuration changes.
- YAML syntax support (for data sources like Yandex Metrica).

### Improved Query Scheduler

The Query Scheduler got a face lift and some new options: you can pick a day for a weekly schedule to run on and also set an end date after which the query will no longer execute on schedule.

### Data Sources

We added Apache Drill, Uptycs and a new JSON data source. Also fixed a few bugs in Athena's query runner and others.

### User Management

The users page got revamped with a new look and feel and few new features:

- An indication when a user was last active.
- Show if an invited user hasn't finished the setup process yet (Pending Invitations section).
- You can now generate a new API key for users, if there's a concern it was compromised.

### Admin

- New Celery queues status screens, replacing the old Queries Status and better reflecting the status of running queries.
- Make the queue name for schema refresh job configurable. The default used to be hard coded `schemas`, which is not available on all setups. Now it's `celery`.
- The `gevent` library is installed by default, and you can now setup gunicorn to use `gevent` based workers.
- New Docker entrypoint command to do a health check for a worker process.
- Flask-Admin is no longer setup or supported.

### Other Changes

- New Alert destination: Google Hangouts Chat.
- When downloading results from the results API it will set a user friendly filename for the downloaded file.
- Archived Queries section added to the queries list.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed: fork query does not fork tables but instead adds default table.
- Fixed: when deleting a visualization, any widget using it was left empty on the dashboard.
- Fixed: issues with Query Editor resizing on new versions of Chrome.
- Fixed: issues with exporting dictionaries to Excel.
- Fixed: Cohort visualization gets stuck when passing string values.
- Fixed: use series name for Pie chart label.
- Make sure Flask app created in Celery's worker process (could cause some query runners to get stuck while running queries).

- We switched to Webpack 4 with the help of @dmonego.
- We upgraded to Celery 4 with the help of @emtwo, @jezdez, @mashrikt and @atharvai.

## v1.0.0-rc.1 - 2017-01-31

This version has two big changes behind the scenes:

- Refactor the frontend to use latest (at the time) Angular version (1.5) along with better frontend pipeline based on)
  WebPack.
- Refactor the backend code to use SQLAlchemy and Alembic, for easier migrations/upgrades.)

Along with that we have many fixes, additions, new data sources (Google Analytics, ClickHouse, Amazon Athena, Snowflake)
and fixes to the existing ones (mainly ElasticSearch and Cassandra).

When upgrading make sure to upgrade from version 0.12.0 and update your .env file:

1. If you have local PostreSQL database, you will need to update the URL from `postgresql://redash` to `postgresql:///redash`.
2. Remove the `REDASH_STATIC_ASSETS_PATH` definition.

Make sure to make these changes before running upgrade as otherwise it will fail.

We're releasing a new upgrade script -- see [here](https://redash.io/help-onpremise/maintenance/how-to-upgrade-redash.html) for details.
