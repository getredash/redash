By default, your query won't have any scheduling but it's super easy to
adjust!

To the left of the last update time, you'll see the schedule area:

Clicking  ' Never ' will open a picker for "every x" or at a specific time of
day. Note: The time you set the scheduling of queries is based on the timezone
of the computer you're using to set it (then it's translated to UTC).

Once a schedule is set, your query will run automatically as instructed to
run.

#### Scheduled Queries with Parameters

When running queries with parameters on a schedule the scheduler will use the
default parameter values for the query execution.
