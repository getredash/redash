    RQ's work horses enforce time limits by setting a timed alarm and stopping jobs
    when they reach their time limits. However, the work horse may be entirely blocked
    and may not respond to the alarm interrupt. Since respecting timeouts is critical
    in Redash (if we don't respect them, workers may be infinitely stuck and as a result,
    service may be denied for other queries), we enforce two time limits:
    1. A soft time limit, enforced by the work horse
    2. A hard time limit, enforced by the parent worker

    The HardLimitingWorker class changes the default monitoring behavior of the default
    RQ Worker by checking if the work horse is still busy with the job, even after
    it should have timed out (+ a grace period of 15s). If it does, it kills the work horse.
