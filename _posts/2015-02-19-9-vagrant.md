To simplify contribution there is a [Vagrant box](https://vagrantcloud.com/redash/boxes/dev) available with all the needed software to run re:dash for development (use it only for development, for demo purposes there is [redash/demo](https://vagrantcloud.com/redash/boxes/demo) box and the AWS/GCE images).

To get started with this box:

1. Make sure you have recent version of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. 
2. Clone the re:dash repository: `git clone https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash.git`.
2. Change dir into the repository (`cd redash`) and run run `vagrant up`. This might take some time the first time you run it, as it downloads the Vagrant virtual box.
3. Once Vagrant is ready, ssh into the instance (`vagrant ssh`), and change dir to `/opt/redash/current` -- this is where your local repository copy synced to.
3. Copy `.env` file into this directory (`cp ../.env ./`).
4. From `/opt/redash/current/rd_ui` run `bower install` to install frontend packages. This can be done from your host machine as well, if you have bower installed.
5. Go back to `/opt/redash/current` and install python dependencies `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Apply migrations
    
    ```
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0001_allow_delete_query.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0002_fix_timestamp_fields.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0003_update_data_source_config.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0004_allow_null_in_event_user.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0005_add_updated_at.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0006_queries_last_edit_by.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0007_add_schedule_to_queries.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0008_make_ds_name_unique.py
    PYTHONPATH=. bin/run python migrations/0009_add_api_key_to_user.py
    ```
7. Start the server and background workers with `bin/run honcho start -f Procfile.dev`.
8. Now the server should be available on your host on port 9001 and you can login with username admin and password admin.
